## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I started with a high level racing game concept and utilized assets from open source repos to build out a playable game engine that would suit a fast paced game loop. Custom skyboxes were made after that with the help of free online tools and track spawning mechanics were implemented and dialed in to the players speed/movement as best as possible.


## Optimizations

I'm happy with the progress and looking forward to adding more features including:

* multiple tracks
* different vehicle options
* drifting mechanics
* boost mechanics
* more engaging styles

and more...


## Lessons Learned:

Game logic remains difficult to successfully implement in a web browser environment but this project taught me alot about how to best factor codebases and optimize modules for a project of this scale. I'm hoping I'll be able to create more engaging game loops and hopefully one day create a multiplayer component with it.
